This is just simply a lightweight functional framework to speed up development and creation of
PHP5 web apps. It was originally designed and coded for a Twitter Clone which will eventually be
open sourced on the same github account you found this framework on.

Documentation is included in the /docs folder and code is commented throughout.

This also includes an extremely lightweight but very usable javascript library this is also documented
under /docs/javascript.

The javascript library will eventually be available seperately under https://github.com/simpleframe/Simple-JavaScript-Library
once it is documented and fully built.
